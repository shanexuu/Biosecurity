The arms join onto a central disc and are covered by clumps of small chisel-like spines. Adults are ~10 cm diameter, with individual arms sometimes up to 40-60 mm long. The topside of the seastar varies in colour and can be yellow, orange or have purple markings. Underneath, they are generally yellow with spines in a single line either side of the groove where the tube feet lie.','The Northern Pacific sea star is a large star fish (up to 50cm in diameter) that is native to the coastal waters of the north-western Pacific Ocean, including Japan, Russia, North China, and Korea. It has been introduced inadvertently to Australia where it occurs in large numbers in several estuaries and embayments in the states of Tasmania and Victoria. The Northern Pacific sea star is normally found in shallow water but occurs from the intertidal area through to the subtidal as deep as 200 m. It can be found on muddy, sandy, pebbly seabeds as well as on rocks and man-made surfaces, even mussel lines. You would not normally see it in areas with high wave action.','The Northern Pacific sea star is a voracious predator that will feed on a wide variety of other marine animals, including shellfish, crabs, worms and even dead fish and other sea stars.

Females reproduce at 1-3 years old and are highly fecund, producing between 185,000 to 200,000 fertilised eggs at a time. The free swimming larvae remain in the plankton for up to 90 days, facilitating dispersal by water currents. It may have been spread intentionally for human consumption or through vessel ballast water or as hull fouling.They are nocturnal, feeding mostly at night.','In some areas where it has been introduced, the European shore crab can reach densities of up to 200 per square metre.

The Mediterranean fanworm extends a spiral fan of yellow-orange filaments to collect plankton from the water column','The Mediterranean fanworm is native to the Mediterranean and Atlantic coast of Europe. It typically occurs in subtidal habitats to a depth of 30 metres that are protected from wave exposure. The fanworm attaches to solid structures such as wharf pilings and shells or small, hard substrata in soft sediments. It has been introduced to Australia and was first detected in New Zealand in 2008. It is now present in a number of New Zealand harbours. The Mediterranean fanworm can persist in a range of water temperatures and salinity. It grows rapidly in summer months and can live for 2-5 years. Larvae may last in the water column for up to 20 days before settling to attach on the seafloor or on port or harbour infrastructure. The Mediterranean fanworm is spread to new locations primarily within vessel biofouling, although the movement of aquaculture equipment or other marine structures may also contribute to its spread.','The Mediterranean fanworm can form dense colonies of up to 1000 individuals per square metre that will exclude the settlement of other organisms. It also has a high filtering ability that may influence the composition of planktonic communities and abundance of some species. The presence of the Mediterranean fanworm in areas where mussels or oysters are located may affect their growth due to competition for food.

Each tube or \"sausage\" is actually a cylinder or tunic, containing numerous small individuals. The long cylindrical heads are generally 5-30 cm long and in some instances can reach 1.5 metres and 5-20 mm in diameter.  The white tunics contain many small individual organisms and can sometimes appear orange flecked due to the presence of bright orange larvae.','The Australian droplet tunicate is an ascidian native to Australia, which forms large colonies that attach to hard substrates. It is generally found in muddy bottomed tidal habitats and on man-made structures such as wharf piles and aquaculture equipment. It is generally submerged just below the waterline, but can often be seen at low tide. The size of the Australian droplet tunicate in New Zealand is influenced by seawater temperatures, with it decreasing in size over the winter months, but rapidly re-growing to its full size once summer arrives.','The Australian droplet tunicate forms dense colonies, smothering beaches, rocks and tide-pools. It displaces native species and grows on boats, aquaculture equipment and other marine structures. It was first reported in New Zealand in early 2005, but was not originally regarded as a pest, given its low density and the fact it appeared to die off in winter.

Under water, two short siphons or openings are visible at the top of the organism. Similar looking native New Zealand species such as Pyura pachydermatina also have a stalk, however, their stalk is much longer.','The clubbed tunicate is an ascidian that grows on both natural and artificial hard marine surfaces. It is most commonly observed on wharf pilings, aquaculture structures, ropes and vessel hulls. They may also be found attached to rocks, seaweed and on shellfish. The clubbed tunicate is found in low energy environments such as ports and harbours and it has wide physiological tolerances. It has been found to reach high densities of 500-1500 individuals per square metre and is an efficient suspension feeder. Because of these two features it can outcompete other species for habitat and food.','The clubbed tunicate can outcompete other species due to it reaching such high densities and being an efficient suspension feeder. As a fouling organism it can decrease the productivity of cultured species and increase aquaculture processing and harvesting costs. It also results in higher fuel and maintenance costs for vessels.

The shell has zig-zag markings and iridescent radiating bands.  The shell is olive green/brown in colour and is easily crushed. It can grow as big as 3 cm in length.','Arcuatula senhousia, commonly known as the Asian date mussel, Asian mussel or bag mussel, is a small saltwater mussel. It is native to the Pacific Ocean from Siberia to Singapore but it has spread to numerous locations around the globe incidentally by vessels (as biofouling or larvae in ballast water) and shellfish aquaculture. It inhabits the intertidal and subtidal zones to a depth of 20 metres and larvae preferentially settle on soft substrate but can settle on hard substrate. It lives entirely in the sediment and produces byssal threads that can form extensive mats on the sediment surface when densities are high. The Asian date mussel is fast growing, short lived (maximum 2 years) and can obtain densities of thousands per square metre. Populations typically fluctuate widely in abundance over time.','The Asian date mussel alters benthic habitats through forming dense mats on soft sediments that can displace benthic communities. As it can obtain high densities and is a suspension feed it can limit the amount of plankton available as food for other species. Also anoxic conditions can occur in the sediment water interface due to the production and decomposition of large volumes of faeces and pseudofaeces.','Prefer soft sediments but also could artificial hard surfaces\r\nUp to 20m depth'),(17,'pest','yes','Wakame Asian Kelp','Undaria pinnatifida (Harvey) Suringar','The appearance of Asian kelp differs depending on its maturity.
